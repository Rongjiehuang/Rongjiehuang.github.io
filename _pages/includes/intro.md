**Rongjie Huang (ÈªÑËûçÊù∞)** is a Third-Year Master's student **(expected to graduate at 2024.03)** in the College of Computer Science and Software at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ). I also have a close collaboration with Speech Research Team at Zhejiang University and ByteDance ([Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) and [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver)). I am a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab (Seattle Lab)](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), where I work with [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ). 

My research interest includes generative AI for speech/sing/audio and audio-visual language processing. I have published several **first-author papers** at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI**.

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.**


Prior to that, I obtained Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Zhejiang University, where I minored in the intensive training program of innovation and entrepreneurship[(ITP)](http://itper.org/index.php/Index).

<!-- Rongjie aims at developing data-driven methods to study the interconnected world and investigates scientific and industrial problems. His research focuses on **multimodal (speech/sing/audio) synthesis, speech translation, and self-supervised learning**.  -->
