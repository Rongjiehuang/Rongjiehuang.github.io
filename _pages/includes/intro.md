**Rongjie Huang (黄融杰)** is a Second-Year Master's student **(expected to graduate at 2024.03)** in the College of Computer Science and Software at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I collaborate with the CMU speech team leaded by [Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ). I also have long-term collaboration with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) and [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver) from **(ByteDance AI Lab)**. I am a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab (Seattle Lab)](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), where I work with [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interest includes generative AI for speech/sing/audio and spoken language processing. I have published 10+ papers at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/IJCAI/ACM-MM.

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.**

Prior to that, I obtained Bachelor’s degree at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Zhi-Wei Hsu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014142) and [Prof. Hang-Fang Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0012062), where I minored in the intensive training program of innovation and entrepreneurship[(ITP)](http://itper.org/index.php/Index).

<!-- Rongjie aims at developing data-driven methods to study the interconnected world and investigates scientific and industrial problems. His research focuses on **multimodal (speech/sing/audio) synthesis, speech translation, and self-supervised learning**.  -->
