During my graduate study, I was lucky to collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by Prof. [Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ), and Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University. I was grateful to collaborate with researchers from TikTok ([Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) and [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver)), and from Tencent Seattle Lab ([Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ)).

My research interest includes **Multi-Modal Generative AI, Multi-Modal Language Processing, and AI4Science**. I have published **first-author papers** at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI**.

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.**
